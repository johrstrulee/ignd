          <h1> ... at the end of a long and winding road.</h1>
          <p>We find our weary hero sitting in a comfortable chair. Staring at nothing. Eyes unfocused. 
            Contemplating the nature of existence and the architecture of the universe. Surrounded by 
            by all of his creepy little friends. Imaginary friends. Dream denizens, fancibeasts, 
            hallucinothings, and the creatures that hide at the bottom of k-holes. The stuff of 
            hightmares had by a schizophrenic. A duck billed mammoth, trees with human heads, and a 
            dragon crossed with a kitchen appliance.

          <p>We value craftsmanship, creativity, originality, experimentation, invention, freedom,
            equality, universal and mutal respect, social cohesion, science, technology, innovation, 
            logical and rational thought over emotionalism, gut feelings, and popular opinions. We exist 
            to make, express, and act. We create Art, write music, fiction, prose, propoganda, and code,  
            and we design and develope unique aesthetically excellent products.

            <p>We act to disrupt the actions 
            of the obsurdly rich. As they rebuild our civilizations in their image. Massive machines disguised 
            as cities that contnually fortify, enhace, and cater to the ultra-rich while  
            marginalizing the poor and eliminating all possible paths out of poverty. Capitalism is not a 
            type freedom and has no fundamental relationship with democracy which is itself inherintly flawed. 
            Popular opinion is often objectively immoral and the massess can be easily confused or convinced 
            to villify certain minorities or violate idividual rights. The basis of any organized and civilized 
            society must at its roots guarantee the fundamental equality, respect, access to the collective 
            knowledgebase of mankind, and the ability to communicate annonymously with any and every person 
            and/or entity anywhere at any time. </p>

          <p>Ultimately leaving civilization without a stable foundation. Teatering precariously on cracked 
            and crumbling pilons battered by waves and Sinking slowly into the mud. Healthy productive natural 
            motivators like craftsmanship, scientific discover, empathy, and ecology supplanted by pure profit. 
            To make money is to make nothing at all and if that is all you have made thats day you have not worked.</p>
