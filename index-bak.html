      <p>In an alternate reality I am given the task of designing the political, social, and economic 
        systems, and institutions. Also cultural issues.

      <h4>Semi-Random Thoughts:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The president of the united states should have at least 1 phd.</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief there is no relationship between capitalism and democracy 
        and neither has anything to do with the level of individual freedom or repression of a 
        particular society. We associate communism and even socialism with repression and 
        authoritarianism because of the soviet union but mostly because we have been told to. 
        A country has an economic system ranging from laissez faire capitalism in which the means
         of production are all privately owned and the only motivation to make anything is 
        profit to pure socialism in which the means of production are public or in the extreme 
        communism which eliminates profit as a motivation and places all control of production in the 
        governments hands. Socialism does not necessarily mean government control it just means public 
        or group control so you could theoretically have an anarchist system of government with 
        zero hierarchy and a socialist economic system in which the means of production are controlled 
        by groups of volunteers that self-organize and make every decision democratically. For such 
        a system to work a well designed framework with a minimal but carefully defined set of rules 
        that guaranteed fundamental human rights, dignity, and equality, provided a mechanism to 
        protect the vulnerable, and prevent any individual from gaining the power to circumvent the 
        non-hierarchical nature of the society and the ability to control others and from hording 
        extreme wealth. Leadership, being just a vital as it is in any society, would function 
        by inspiring and motivating by example rather than fear, power and control. </p>
      <p>
        Profit would not be a motivator and would be replaced by natural motivators that are 
        actually inline with the various organizations, projects, and society as a whole. Craftsmanship, 
        scientific discovery, creative expresson, saving lives, improving health, fostering social 
        cohesion, protecting the environment, etc, etc.., Profit is artificial and a distraction. To 
        work for profit is often contrary to these goals that result in better products and better lives. 
        If the only thing you make at work is money you have not made anything and you have not worked.

    <div class="plan"><h4>Goals, plans, proccess, cast a wide net and collect unique, finds.</h4>
       <p></p> We need a stack, no To make things. To develope a creative product development business committed to craftsmanship, 
        aesthetic excellence, and originality. It must always remain agile and reactive. Able to quickly identify 
        opportunities, reprioritize, and focus design and development efforts to best take advantage of these 
        opportunities. Initial strategy is as follows: In order to make the things we ultimately want to make 
        we must first collect atrtifects of the past, discover oddities in the knooks and crannies of 
        the world. Deditiacated figmentography, 
      
      
      
        build at an inventory will require cash. So the first initial priority is to make money by any means necessarty. 
        Look for investments, grants, loans, and jobs.q look for product ideas with the highest possible odds 
        of being easy to sell for a reasonable profit. Retain a skeptical eye but embrace a vivid imagination.
