Capitalism is a corrosive that causes infrastructure to rust, crumble, errode, and collapse. 

Ultimately leaving civilization without a stable foundation. Teatering precariously on cracked and crumbling pilons battered by waves and Sinking slowly into the mud. Healthy productive natural motivators like craftsmanship, scientific discover, empathy, and ecology supplanted by pure profit. To make money is to make nothing at all and if that is all you have made thats day you have not worked.



We value craftsmanship, creativity, originality, experimentation   invention, freedom,  equality, universal and mutal respect, social cohesion, science, technology, innovation, logical and rational thought over emotionalism, gut feelings, and popular opinions. We exist to make, express, and act. We create Art, write music, fiction, prose, propoganda, and code,  and we design and develope unique aesthetically excellent products. We act to disrupt the actions of the obsurdly rich. As they rebuild our civilizations in their image. Massive machines disguised as cities that contnually fortify, enhace, and cater to the ultra-rich while continually marginalizing the poor and eliminating all possible paths out of poverty. Capitalism is not a type freedom and has no fundamental relationship with democracy which is itself inherintly flawed. Popular opinion is often objectively immoral and the massess can be easily confused or convinced to villify certain minorities or violate idividual rights. The basis of any organized and civilized society must at its roots guarantee the fundamental equality, respect, access to the collective knowledgebase of mankind, and the ability to communicate annonymously with any and every person and/or entity anywhere at any time.
